## Repercussions of Bitcoin

Bitcoin shows that social organization is becoming a high tech information technology.  In order to evolve bitcoin
and technologies like it, and at the same time improve society to the degree that aspects are now structured by these
technologies, we have the old information technology integration problems to solve.

## Beyond BIPs or RFCs

There is a long history and broad range of technologies for shallow or deep information 
systems integration, from CORBA to Java to REST.  Ethereum smart contracts shows one example of deep integration
based on the blockchain concept.

What we really need (still) is a common technology that really facilitates automated deep integration between systems.

The fundamental limitations of something like a text document in a BIP or an RFC are fairly well-known, but they
all stem from the poor integration between the human and technical aspects of the decision structures and
protocols/systems they control. 

In contrast, take for example a leading-edge open software module registry and ecosystem like `npm`.  This system
provides semantic versioning to manage dependencies and offers the fundamental advantage of nearly instant
integration between pieces of software.  So one could compare the effort involved with upgrading a popular
module into a Node.js application versus ratifying a BIP by committee and implementing new protocol features from 
scratch.

## Web Assembly

Web assembly has the potential to finally become a ubiquitous way to share code across platforms and programming 
languages.  The ideal would be for there to be a web assembly module registry, which would allow open source 
publishing of semantically versioned modules written in one of many languages on several platforms.  Then core blockchain
protocols could be implemented and published to this module, and consumed by application developers on any platform
or programming language.  This is not a new ideal, since these issues are as old as information technology.
The popularity and widespread deployment of existing web technologies like JavaScript makes one hopeful about
the adoption potential of web assembly.
